I'm a Cloud Security Architect (transitioning from IT Business Analyst) with 10+ years of experience aligning technology with business needs. My focus is on secure design, infrastructure-as-code, and cloud identity strategies across AWS, Azure, and GCP.

---

## 🔐 What I Do

- Architect secure, scalable cloud environments  
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) and identity federation  
- Design compliant infrastructure with ISO 20022, PCI-DSS, and HIPAA in mind  
- Translate business requirements into actionable, risk-aware cloud solutions  
- Build hands-on projects that reflect real-world security architecture

## 📌 Featured GitHub Projects

### ✅ [Azure RBAC + SSO Lab](https://github.com/karlomodt/azure-rbac-sso-demo)
Simulated identity federation using Azure AD, RBAC, and a Linux-based web server. Documented architecture, limitations, and secure design practices.

### 🛠 [Azure RBAC + SSO Lab – Terraform Edition](https://github.com/karlomodt/azure-rbac-sso-terraform-edition)
Automated version of the above using Terraform. Deploys secure Azure infrastructure with NSGs, RBAC, and hardening steps — plus a teardown script.

### 🔄 [IAM Lifecycle Simulation](https://github.com/karlomodt/iam-lifecycle-sim)
Models identity provisioning, access assignment, and deprovisioning for secure systems. Focused on audit trails and access governance logic.

### 📁 Additional Projects Available
